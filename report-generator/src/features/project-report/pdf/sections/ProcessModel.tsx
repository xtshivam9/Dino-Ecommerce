      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The selection of an appropriate process model is a critical decision
        that influences project organization, communication patterns, and the
        ability to respond to changing requirements. This section describes the
        Agile Development Methodology adopted for the dj-ecommerce project,
        providing justification for this choice and detailing its
        implementation.

      <Text style={styles.h3}>6.2.1 Agile Methodology Overview</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Agile software development is a set of principles and practices that
        emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and
        responsiveness to change. Unlike traditional waterfall approaches that
        attempt to define all requirements upfront and proceed through
        sequential phases, Agile embraces the inherent uncertainty in software
        development and uses it as an opportunity for continuous improvement.

      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The Agile approach is codified in the Agile Manifesto, which values:

        For this project, a Scrum-influenced Agile approach was adopted,
        organizing work into time-boxed iterations called sprints. This provided
        the structure needed for planning and tracking while maintaining the
        flexibility to adapt to discoveries made during development.

      <Text style={styles.h3}>6.2.2 Justification for Agile Selection</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Several factors influenced the decision to adopt Agile for the dj-ecommerce
        project. Each factor addresses specific characteristics of the project
        that made Agile particularly suitable.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Iterative Development Needs:</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The e-commerce storefront—the core feature of dj-ecommerce—required
        extensive iteration to achieve an intuitive user experience. It was not
        possible to fully specify the editor's behavior upfront; instead, the
        design evolved through cycles of implementation, evaluation, and
        refinement. Agile's iterative approach accommodated this evolution
        naturally.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Evolving Requirements:</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        As development progressed, new insights emerged about user needs,
        technical constraints, and integration possibilities. The initial
        requirement for basic AI integration, for example, expanded to include
        multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) as their capabilities
        and value became apparent. Agile's embrace of change made these
        adaptations feasible.

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Risk Mitigation:</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The technical complexity of integrating multiple technologies (Next.js,
        React Flow, Inngest, tRPC, Prisma) presented significant risk. Agile's
        approach of building working software incrementally meant that
        integration issues were discovered and resolved early, rather than
        accumulating until a single integration phase.

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Continuous Delivery Value:</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Each sprint produced potentially deployable software, enabling ongoing
        demonstration and validation. This visibility into progress helped
        maintain momentum and provided regular opportunities for feedback and
        course correction.

        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprints 1-2: Foundation</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The initial sprints established the project foundation including
        repository setup, development environment configuration, and core
        infrastructure. The Next.js application was initialized with TypeScript,
        Tailwind CSS was configured for styling, and the Prisma schema was
        designed to support users, teams, orders, and executions. Better Auth
        was integrated for authentication with Google and GitHub OAuth
        providers.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprints 3-4: Visual Editor</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        These sprints focused on the core e-commerce storefront. React Flow was
        integrated as the canvas library, and custom product components were
        created for different product types (triggers, actions, AI products). The
        connection system was implemented with validation to prevent invalid
        connections. Workflow serialization enabling save and load functionality
        was developed, along with the order management API.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprints 5-6: Order State Management</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The order state management sprints integrated Inngest for durable function
        execution. A order parser was developed to convert the visual
        representation into executable steps. Model executors were implemented
        for each product type, with proper error handling, retry logic, and state
        management between steps.

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprints 7-8: Service Integrations</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Integration sprints added connectivity to external services. The HTTP
        Request product was implemented supporting all common HTTP methods with
        configurable headers, body, and authentication. The credential
        management system was built to securely store and use API keys. Slack
        integration enabled sending messages to channels and users. Email
        integration was implemented via SMTP configuration.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprint 9: AI Capabilities</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        This sprint added AI integration as a first-class feature. Models were
        created for OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Anthropic (Claude 3 Sonnet, Opus),
        and Google (Gemini Pro, Flash). Each product supports configurable prompts,
        system messages, temperature, and token limits. The implementation
        abstracts provider differences while exposing relevant configuration
        options.

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprint 10: Team Features</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Team collaboration features were implemented including role-based access
        control with Owner, Admin, Member, and Viewer roles. Team management
        functionality allows creating teams, inviting members, and managing
        roles. Credentials can be shared within teams with appropriate
        permission controls.

        <Text style={styles.bold}>Sprints 11-12: Testing and Deployment</Text>
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The final sprints focused on quality assurance and production readiness.
        Comprehensive testing was performed including unit tests, integration
        tests, and end-to-end order testing. Bugs discovered during testing
        were fixed. The production environment was configured on Netlify with
        PostgreSQL on Neon and Inngest Cloud for execution. The application was
        deployed at https://flowgent.app. Monitoring and logging were
        established using Sentry.

        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Continuous Integration:</Text> Code was
          committed frequently and integrated continuously. The CI pipeline ran
          tests on each commit to catch regressions early.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Code Review:</Text> All changes were
          reviewed before merging. This caught bugs, improved code quality, and
          shared knowledge across the codebase.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Refactoring:</Text> Technical debt was
          addressed continuously rather than allowed to accumulate. When
          patterns became clearer, code was refactored to improve
          maintainability.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Test-Driven Development:</Text> For
          critical components like the order parser and product executors, tests
          were written before implementation to clarify requirements and ensure
          correctness.

        Given the nature of the dj-ecommerce project—with evolving requirements,
        significant UI/UX iteration needs, and integration of multiple
        technologies—Agile provided the optimal balance of structure and
        flexibility. The waterfall approach would have been too rigid for the
        iterative UI development needed, while spiral's emphasis on formal risk
        analysis was unnecessary for this project's scale.

        The Agile methodology provided an effective framework for developing the
        dj-ecommerce platform. Through twelve one-week sprints, the project
        progressed from initial setup to a fully functional e-commerce
        platform. The iterative approach enabled continuous feedback and
        adaptation, while the sprint ceremonies ensured consistent planning,
        review, and improvement. The lessons learned from this Agile
