      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations of all
        sizes face mounting pressure to streamline their operations, reduce
        manual intervention, and improve overall efficiency. The proliferation
        of cloud-based services, APIs, and SaaS applications has created both
        opportunities and challenges for businesses seeking to automate their
        orders and integrate disparate systems.

      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        While numerous e-commerce platforms exist in the market, each
        comes with its own set of limitations that prevent widespread adoption
        among non-technical users. This chapter provides a comprehensive
        analysis of the current challenges in e-commerce, examines
        existing solutions and their shortcomings, and establishes the
        foundation for the proposed dj-ecommerce platform.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The need for accessible, reliable, and intelligent e-commerce
        has never been greater. Organizations that fail to adopt automation face
        reduced productivity, increased operational costs, and diminished
        competitive advantage in an increasingly digital marketplace.

      {/* 2.2 Problem Statement */}
      <Text style={styles.h2}>2.2 Problem Statement</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Modern organizations encounter several interconnected challenges when
        attempting to automate their business processes and integrate various
        software systems. These challenges can be categorized into four primary
        areas: manual process overhead, technical barriers to automation,
        integration complexity, and reliability concerns.
      </Text>

      {/* 2.2.1 Manual Process Overhead */}
      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.2.1 Manual Process Overhead</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Despite the availability of sophisticated software tools, many business
        operations continue to rely heavily on manual interventions for tasks
        that could potentially be automated. These manual processes create
        significant operational bottlenecks and introduce opportunities for
        human error.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Common examples of manual process overhead include:
      </Text>
      <View style={{ marginLeft: 24, marginBottom: 6 }}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Data Entry and Transfer:</Text> Employees
          frequently copy data manually between systems, such as transferring
          customer information from web forms to CRM systems, updating
          spreadsheets with data from emails, or synchronizing inventory levels
          across multiple platforms.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Report Generation:</Text> Creating
          periodic reports often involves gathering data from multiple sources,
          formatting it consistently, and distributing it to stakeholders—a
          process that can consume hours of valuable time each week.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Notification Management:</Text> Sending
          timely notifications to team members, customers, or partners based on
          specific events or conditions typically requires constant monitoring
          and manual intervention.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• File Processing:</Text> Tasks such as
          converting file formats, extracting information from documents,
          organizing files into appropriate folders, and backing up important
          data are often performed manually.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Cross-System Synchronization:</Text>{" "}
          Maintaining consistency across multiple software platforms requires
          regular manual updates, leading to data discrepancies and outdated
          information.
        </Text>
      </View>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The cumulative impact of these manual processes is substantial.
        According to industry research, knowledge workers spend an average of
        4.5 hours per week on routine, repetitive tasks that could be automated.
        For a mid-sized organization with 100 knowledge workers, this translates
        to over 23,000 hours of potentially automatable work annually.
      </Text>

      {/* 2.2.2 Technical Barrier to Automation */}
      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.2.2 Technical Barrier to Automation</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        One of the most significant obstacles to widespread automation adoption
        is the technical expertise required to implement and maintain automated
        orders. Traditional automation solutions typically demand programming
        knowledge, creating a substantial barrier for business users who
        understand their processes intimately but lack the coding skills to
        automate them.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        This technical barrier manifests in several ways:
      </Text>
      <View style={{ marginLeft: 24, marginBottom: 6 }}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Programming Requirements:</Text> Many
          automation platforms require users to write code in languages such as
          Python, JavaScript, or proprietary scripting languages. Even
          "low-code" solutions often require understanding of programming
          concepts like variables, conditionals, and loops.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• API Comprehension:</Text> Integrating with
          external services requires understanding REST APIs, authentication
          mechanisms (OAuth, API keys), request/response formats (JSON, XML),
          and error handling—concepts unfamiliar to most non-technical users.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Debugging Complexity:</Text> When
          automations fail, diagnosing the root cause often requires technical
          analysis of logs, stack traces, and system behavior that business
          users are ill-equipped to perform.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Dependency on IT Teams:</Text>{" "}
          Organizations frequently rely on IT departments or external developers
          to create and maintain automations, creating bottlenecks and
          increasing costs. IT teams, already stretched thin managing critical
          infrastructure, may deprioritize automation requests.
        </Text>
      </View>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The consequence of this technical barrier is a significant automation
        gap: the people who best understand the processes that need automation
        are often unable to implement the solutions themselves, while those with
        the technical skills to automate may lack the domain knowledge to design
        effective orders.
      </Text>

      {/* 2.2.3 Integration Complexity */}
      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.2.3 Integration Complexity</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Modern businesses typically utilize a diverse ecosystem of software
        applications and services. The average mid-sized company uses over 120
        SaaS applications, each designed to solve specific business problems.
        While this software diversity enables specialized functionality, it
        creates significant challenges when these systems need to work together.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Integration complexity arises from several factors:
      </Text>
      <View style={{ marginLeft: 24, marginBottom: 6 }}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Diverse API Standards:</Text> Different
          services implement their APIs using various standards, authentication
          methods, data formats, and conventions. What works for one API may not
          work for another, requiring unique integration code for each service.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Authentication Challenges:</Text> Services
          use different authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth 2.0,
          JWT tokens, and basic authentication. Managing credentials securely
          across multiple integrations adds complexity.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Data Transformation Requirements:</Text>{" "}
          Data from one system often needs to be transformed before it can be
          used by another. This includes format conversion, field mapping, data
          validation, and handling missing or null values.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Rate Limiting and Quotas:</Text> Most APIs
          impose rate limits and usage quotas that integrations must respect.
          Building systems that gracefully handle these constraints without
          losing data requires sophisticated retry logic.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Version Management:</Text> APIs evolve
          over time, and integrations must adapt to breaking changes, deprecated
          endpoints, and new functionality while maintaining backward
          compatibility.
        </Text>
      </View>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Building custom integrations between systems is expensive and
        time-consuming. A single point-to-point integration can take weeks or
        months to develop, test, and deploy. With dozens or hundreds of
        potential integration points, organizations face an exponentially
        growing integration challenge that traditional approaches cannot address
        cost-effectively.

      {/* 2.2.4 Reliability and Monitoring Concerns */}
      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.2.4 Reliability and Monitoring Concerns</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        For automation to deliver its promised benefits, orders must execute
        reliably and provide visibility into their operation. However, ensuring
        reliability in distributed automation systems presents significant
        challenges that many existing solutions fail to address adequately.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Key reliability concerns include:</Text>
      <View style={{ marginLeft: 24, marginBottom: 6 }}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Transient Failures:</Text> Network
          timeouts, temporary service outages, and rate limiting can cause
          order steps to fail even when the underlying logic is correct.
          Systems must handle these failures gracefully without losing work or
          creating inconsistent states.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• State Management:</Text> Long-running
          orders may span hours or days, requiring the system to maintain
          state across execution steps. If the automation platform experiences
          downtime, it must be able to resume orders from where they left
          off.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Error Visibility:</Text> When failures
          occur, users need clear, actionable information about what went wrong
          and how to fix it. Cryptic error messages or missing context make
          troubleshooting difficult and time-consuming.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Execution Monitoring:</Text> Operators
          need real-time visibility into order execution status, including
          which steps are running, which have completed, and which have failed.
          Historical execution data enables performance analysis and
          optimization.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>• Audit Requirements:</Text> For compliance
          and security purposes, organizations often need detailed audit trails
          showing who created or modified orders, when executions occurred,
          and what data was processed.

      {/* 2.3 Market Demand & Industry Trends */}
      <Text style={styles.h2}>2.3 Market Demand & Industry Trends</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The global e-commerce market has been experiencing significant
        growth, driven by the increasing need for operational efficiency and

        initiative, up from 20% in 2022.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The proliferation of SaaS applications within enterprises (an average of
        130+ per mid-size company) has created an urgent need for integration
        and automation tools. Additionally, the shortage of professional

      {/* 2.6 Gap Analysis */}
      <Text style={styles.h2}>2.6 Gap Analysis</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Based on the comparative analysis of existing solutions, several
        significant gaps in the current market offerings have been identified.
        These gaps represent opportunities for improvement that the dj-ecommerce
        platform aims to address.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.6.1 Accessibility Gap</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        While platforms like WooCommerce offer user-friendly interfaces, they
        sacrifice power and flexibility. Conversely, powerful platforms like Shopify
        require technical expertise. There is a clear need for a platform that
        combines the accessibility of consumer tools with the capabilities of
        developer-focused solutions.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.6.2 Discount & Coupon Engine Gap</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The rapid advancement of AI technologies, particularly large language
        models, has created new possibilities for intelligent automation.
        However, existing platforms offer only limited AI capabilities,
        typically through basic integrations rather than native, deeply
        integrated features. Users increasingly want to leverage AI for content
        generation, data analysis, decision-making, and natural language
        processing within their orders.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.6.3 Deployment Flexibility Gap</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Organizations with strict data governance requirements need the ability
        to self-host their automation infrastructure. While Shopify offers this
        capability, it comes with significant complexity. There is demand for a
        solution that offers easy deployment on modern cloud platforms like
        Netlify while maintaining data sovereignty.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.6.4 Team Collaboration Gap</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Modern orders are rarely created or managed by individuals working in
        isolation. Teams need to collaborate on order design, share
        credentials securely, and manage access permissions. While enterprise
        tiers of existing platforms offer role-based access control, these
        features are often priced beyond the reach of small and medium
        businesses.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.6.5 Reliability and Observability Gap</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Many automation platforms treat reliability as an afterthought,
        providing minimal retry logic and limited visibility into execution
        status. For business-critical orders, organizations need guaranteed
        execution with automatic retry, dead-letter queues for failed messages,
        and comprehensive logging for debugging and compliance.

      {/* 2.7 Proposed Solution Overview */}
      <Text style={styles.h2}>2.7 Proposed Solution Overview</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        To address the identified problems and gaps in existing solutions, this
        project proposes the development of dj-ecommerce—a next-generation visual
        e-commerce platform designed from the ground up to be
        accessible, powerful, and reliable.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.7.1 Core Principles</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        dj-ecommerce is built on four foundational principles that guide all design
        and implementation decisions:
      </Text>
      <View style={{ marginLeft: 24, marginBottom: 6 }}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>1. Visual-First Design:</Text> Every feature
          is designed with visual representation as the primary interface. Users
          should be able to understand, create, and modify orders through
          intuitive drag-and-drop interactions without writing code.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>2. Reliability by Default:</Text> Workflows
          should execute reliably without users needing to implement complex
          error handling. The platform handles retries, state persistence, and
          failure recovery automatically.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>3. AI-Native Architecture:</Text> Rather
          than treating AI as an add-on, dj-ecommerce integrates AI capabilities as
          first-class citizens. Users can leverage multiple AI providers
          (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) through consistent, easy-to-use products.
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, marginBottom: 3, lineHeight: 1.5 }}>
          <Text style={styles.bold}>4. Self-Hosted and Extensible:</Text>
          dj-ecommerce supports self-hosted deployment, allowing organizations to
          run on their own infrastructure with full data sovereignty. The
          modular architecture enables customization and future feature
          expansion.

      {/* 2.8 Justification for New Development */}
      <Text style={styles.h2}>2.8 Justification for New Development</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Given the existence of multiple e-commerce platforms in the
        market, it is essential to justify the development of a new solution.
        The following factors support the decision to create dj-ecommerce rather
        than adopt or extend an existing platform:
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.8.1 Unique Value Proposition</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        No existing solution combines all the following characteristics:
        affordable pricing, modern technology stack, native AI integration,
        self-hosting capability, and team collaboration features accessible to
        small businesses. dj-ecommerce aims to be the first platform to offer this
        complete package.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.8.2 Modern Technology Foundation</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Many existing platforms were architected years ago and carry technical
        debt that limits their ability to adopt modern best practices. By
        building on the latest technologies (Next.js 16, React 19, Inngest),
        dj-ecommerce benefits from improved performance, developer experience, and
        maintainability.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.8.3 Academic and Learning Objectives</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        As an academic project, dj-ecommerce provides an opportunity to apply
        software engineering principles, explore modern web development
        practices, and gain hands-on experience with production-grade
        technologies. The project scope allows for comprehensive coverage of the
        software development lifecycle.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2.8.4 Community Contribution</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        dj-ecommerce is developed as an academic project with a long-term vision of
        evolving into a commercially viable SaaS product. While the current
        version serves as a proof-of-concept built during the BCA programme, the
        architecture and technology stack have been deliberately chosen to
        support future scalability and monetization. Organizations seeking
        modern e-commerce solutions would benefit from a platform built
        on contemporary, production-grade technologies that can be deployed and
        scaled as a startup offering.

      {/* 2.9 Summary */}
      <Text style={styles.h2}>2.9 Summary</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        This chapter has established the context and motivation for the dj-ecommerce
        e-commerce platform. Modern organizations face significant
        challenges in automating their business processes, including manual
        process overhead, technical barriers, integration complexity, and
        reliability concerns.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Analysis of existing solutions reveals that while capable platforms
        exist, none fully addresses the combination of accessibility, power, AI
        integration, and deployment flexibility that organizations increasingly
        demand. The identified gaps—in accessibility, AI integration, deployment
        options, team collaboration, and reliability—represent the opportunities
        that dj-ecommerce aims to address.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The proposed solution applies modern technologies and architectural
        patterns to create a platform that is visually intuitive, inherently
        reliable, AI-native, and open for customization. The following chapters
        will detail the project objectives, system architecture, implementation
        approach, and validation of the developed platform.
