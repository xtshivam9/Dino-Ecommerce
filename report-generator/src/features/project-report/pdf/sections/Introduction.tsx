      <Text style={styles.h2}>1.1 Project Overview</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        In the contemporary digital landscape, the agility with which an
        organization can adapt its operational orders is a definitive factor
        in its success. As businesses increasingly rely on a diverse array of
        digital tools—from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and
        marketing platforms to cloud databases and communication channels—the
        complexity of managing data flow between these disparate systems has
        grown exponentially.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        <Text style={styles.bold}>dj-ecommerce</Text> is a state-of-the-art,
        visual e-commerce platform designed to address this challenge.
        It provides a bridge between technical capability and operational
        necessity, allowing users to orchestrate complex business logic through
        an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface. By abstracting the intricacies of
        API integrations, data transformation, and conditional logic into visual
        "products," dj-ecommerce democratizes automation.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The platform empowers product managers, marketing teams, and operations
        specialists to build, test, and deploy sophisticated orders without
        writing a single line of code, while still offering the extensibility
        required by developers. Built on a modern stack comprising{" "}
        <Text style={styles.bold}>Next.js 16, React Flow, and Inngest</Text>,
        the platform features a robust, durable order state management.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h2}>1.2 Background</Text>
      <Text style={styles.h3}>1.2.1 The Digital Transformation Era</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The last decade has witnessed a massive shift towards digital
        transformation. Organizations of all sizes have moved their operations
        to the cloud, adopting Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions for
        virtually every business function. While this digitization has improved
        capabilities, it has also led to "SaaS Sprawl"—a phenomenon where
        critical business data is fragmented across dozens of unconnected
        applications.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        For instance, a simple process like "Onboarding a New Client" might
        involve creating a record in Salesforce, sending a welcome email via
        SendGrid, setting up a project workspace in Trello or Jira, and creating
        a shared folder in Google Drive. Performing these steps manually is
        time-consuming, prone to human error, and unscalable.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>1.2.2 The Integration Gap</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        To solve this fragmentation, the industry has traditionally relied on
        two approaches: point-to-point custom integrations written by
        developers, or rigid, linear automation tools. Custom integrations are
        expensive to build and maintain, often becoming "technical debt" as APIs
        change. Legacy automation tools, on the other hand, often lack the
        flexibility to handle complex branching logic, loops, or
        human-in-the-loop interactions.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        This creates an "Integration Gap": a situation where the business need
        for automation vastly outstrips the technical capacity to implement it.
        dj-ecommerce aims to close this gap by providing a platform that is
        practically as easy to use as consumer tools but theoretically as
        powerful as custom code.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h2}>1.3 Problem Statement</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        Despite the availability of automation tools, several critical problems
        persist in the current landscape:
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>1. High Technical Barrier</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Traditional orchestration platforms (like Airflow or Temporal) are
        code-first, requiring significant expertise in Python, Go, or Java. This
        excludes non-technical subject matter experts from the automation
        process, creating a bottleneck where every order change requires
        engineering time.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2. Operational Fragility</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Simplistic automation tools often fail silently. If an API is
        temporarily down or a rate limit is hit, the order fails, and data is
        lost. Building "durable" execution—where steps are retried automatically
        and state is preserved across crashes—is mathematically complex and
        difficult to implement from scratch.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>3. Cost and Lock-in</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Enterprise Integration Platforms as a Service (iPaaS) like MuleSoft or
        Boomi involve exorbitant licensing fees and multi-year contracts.
        Conversely, entry-level tools often become prohibitively expensive as
        usage scales (e.g., paying per "operation"), punishing success.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>4. Lack of Developer Experience</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Many no-code tools are "black boxes." If a user needs a specific data
        transformation that isn't pre-built, they are stuck. There is a lack of
        platforms that offer a "low-code" escape hatch, allowing developers to
        inject custom JavaScript or TypeScript where needed.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h2}>1.4 Motivation</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        The motivation behind developing dj-ecommerce is rooted in the
        philosophy of{" "}
        <Text style={styles.bold}>"Software Democratization."</Text> We believe
        that the ability to automate work should not be a privilege reserved for
        software engineers.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        By building a visual layer on top of a durable order state management, we aim
        to encourage a new class of "Citizen Developers"—operational experts who
        can build their own tools. Furthermore, the decision to build this as a
        modern web application using React 19 and Next.js 16 was driven by a
        desire to push the boundaries of what is possible in a browser-based
        IDE.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Additionally, with the rise of Generative AI, there is a unique
        opportunity to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the
        automation flow, allowing orders to not just move data, but to
        "think" about it—summarizing text, categorizing support tickets, or
        generating diverse content.

      <Text style={styles.h2}>1.6 Proposed Solution</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraphIndent}>
        dj-ecommerce architecture follows an Event-Driven design pattern. The
        solution consists of three main components:
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>1. The Visual Frontend (React Flow)</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        A client-side Single Page Application (SPA) where the order state is
        managed using React 19 with Next.js 16 App Router. It serializes the
        visual graph (products and edges) into a JSON structure that represents the
        "definition" of the automated process. The editor provides real-time
        validation, auto-save functionality, and collaborative editing support.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>2. The Orchestration Layer (Inngest)</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Unlike traditional cron jobs, dj-ecommerce utilizes a specialized
        orchestration queue. When a order is triggered, an event is pushed to
        this queue. The Inngest engine then "plays" the order definition,
        executing step 1, waiting for the result, then executing step 2, and so
        on. This decoupling allows for massive scalability and ensures durable
        execution with automatic retries.
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.h3}>3. The Integration Layer</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        A collection of server-side functions that perform the actual work
        (e.g., calling the OpenAI API, querying a PostgreSQL database, sending
        Slack messages). These functions are stateless and idempotent where
        possible, ensuring reliability and predictability.
